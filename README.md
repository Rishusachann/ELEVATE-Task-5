# ELEVATE-Task-5

 **process explained in a short paragraph form** 

---

To complete Task 5 on Decision Trees and Random Forests, you start by opening Google Colab and installing any necessary libraries like Graphviz for tree visualization. Then, upload your dataset (such as `heart.csv`) and load it into a DataFrame using pandas. Next, you prepare your data by separating features and the target column, and split it into training and testing sets. Once the data is ready, you train a basic Decision Tree model and visualize it to understand how decisions are made based on feature values. To avoid overfitting, you limit the depth of the tree and compare the modelâ€™s performance on both training and testing data. After that, you build a Random Forest classifier, which uses multiple trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. You then analyze which features are most important in making predictions and evaluate the model using cross-validation to check for stability. To further assess the model, you generate a confusion matrix, classification report, and an ROC curve to visualize its performance. You can go beyond this by tuning hyperparameters, comparing different splitting criteria like Gini and Entropy, and checking how the model performs with different training sizes or random seeds. This process not only helps you build accurate models but also teaches you how to interpret and trust their predictions.
